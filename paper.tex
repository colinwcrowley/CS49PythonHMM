% This is a template for the writeup of your final project.  Note:
% sample-paper.tex is a sample paper created using this template.
% It's a reasonable example of a ten-ish page .tex paper.
%
% To Compile this, do the following:
% > pdflatex sample-paper
% > bibtex sample-paper
% > pdflatex sample-paper
% > pdflatex sample-paper

% definitely use the article class and 11 pt font.
\documentclass[11pt]{article}

% definitely use fullpage package
\usepackage{fullpage}
\usepackage{amsmath,amsthm,amssymb,amsfonts,mathtools,textcomp,enumerate}
\DeclareMathOperator*{\argmax}{\arg\!\max}

\newcommand{\Tau}{\mathrm{T}}
\newcommand{\E}{\mathrm{E}}
% Include optional other packages here.

% If you have lots of macros and other new command definitions
% consider creating a separate header.tex file.
% If you use this, uncomment the following line:
%\input{header}

% Next, include a title
\title{Hidden Markov Models}

% Put all author information here.
% Since it's just a final project paper, don't feel like you need
%  to include emails or affiliations.
\author{Colin Crowley \& Julian Segert}

% This suppresses the date.
% if you skip it, the date will be automatically be included
\date{}

% starts the document
\begin{document}

% This sets up the title/author/date information
\maketitle

% The abstract is a 1-2 paragraph synopsis of your project and
%  what you accomplished.
\begin{abstract}
\end{abstract}

% I like to keep each section of a paper in a different .tex file,
%  but you're certainly under no obligation to.
% The \input command essentially cut'n'pastes content from e.g.
%  intro.tex into this .tex file

%\input{intro}
\input{analysis.tex}
%\input{prelim}
%\input{firstresult}
%\input{secondresult}
%\input{conclusion}


%--------------------------------- bibliography -------------------------
% Thus is a common way to do bibliographies called bibtex
%  write bibtex entries in a .bib file (ours was super.bib)
% Let me know if you have questions on how to this, and/or
%  try to mimic what we do here
\bibliographystyle{plain}
\bibliography{super}

% Here's how to do appendices
\appendix
%\input{maintechnicalstuff}
%\input{otherstuff}

\end{document}
