\section{Conclusion}
We have seen that Hidden Markov Models are useful tools for modeling diverse probabilistic systems. We have presented and analyzed algorithms for computing useful properties of HMMs with relatively fast runtime. Included is a Python implementation of a HMM and the algorithms discussed above, along with relevant test code.
