\section{Conclusion}
We have seen that Hidden Markov Models are useful tools for modeling
diverse probabilistic systems. We have presented and analyzed algorithms
for computing useful properties of HMMs with relatively fast runtime.
Included is a Python implementation of a HMM and the algorithms
discussed above, along with relevant test code. While useful, HMMs do
have their limitations. For example, in many situations, one cannot
assume the Markov Property or doing so would limit the predictive
power of the model. HMMs are most useful in situations like speech
recognition or genetics where we have some a priori knowledge of the
internal parameters.
